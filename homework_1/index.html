            First name: Greatest, last name: Ever. Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothing to play with. Born in Irkutsk, Russia, raised in Des
            Moines, Iowa! Attended the University of Northern Iowa and majored in Interactive Digital Studies. Moved up to Minneapolis right after college.

            More about me: physically the opposite of Randy Moss. I like comedies and Ihave horrible eyesight. My favorite movie about toys is Toy Story. 
            I haven't read a book in about a year. I randomly think about what happened to Ty Pennington after Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.
            I really enjoy old school hip hop and 80s rock.
